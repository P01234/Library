# Library
<h1>Library App</h1>
<p>Must be the hardest yet, this one took me a couple of tries and re-writes but overall, a fun project. Library App was the first OOP project that I've
done, the very first, and it was done using some very basic prototype chain, I was focusing in understand the OOP logic before moving to its concepts,
so it may not seem that much for some people.</p>
